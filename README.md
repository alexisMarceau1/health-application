# health-application

The goal of this project is to create an application for "Sant√© publique France" that provides users with quick and visual insights into the nutritional quality of food products. Using the Open Food Facts database, the application will offer an estimation of nutritional quality, particularly for products that lack standard labels like the Nutri-Score or are foreign.
